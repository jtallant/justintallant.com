title: Finally Using My Custom CMS Skimpy
---
This blog is created with my own open source cms called Skimpy. I got it into a working state years ago and then just forgot about it. Oh well, here I am years later using this old software. It's actually still pretty cool IMO. It's super simple to use. If you like writing in Markdown, and you don't want to compile your site, and you like twig then you might like Skimpy. Give it a shot!
