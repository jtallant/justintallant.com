title: Thoughts on Tailwind CSS

At first I thought Tailwind CSS was awesome, and in many ways, it is awesome but...

After using it for some time I have decided to just switch back to traditional CSS. Yes, this site still has tailwind code on it, I'm not going to go through and remove it, but for new projects I'll just be writing traditional CSS. I miss the days of being able to read HTML and easily understand where my components are and what they are for. The slew of class names is just too much to look at. And now that I'm using cursor (chat gpt, copilot, etc), tailwind isn't really saving me any time. I can crank out some vanilla markup and then use Cursor's Copilot/GPT integration to get some advanced styling going quite quickly. After that I just assign some semantic class names to my easily readable HTML and move on.

In the end, I just feel less confused. It's easier to work with my markup when it comes to page layouts, templating, reactive javascript, everything. Now that coding assistants are so good, I find that my general ability to look through my applications quickly and reason about them is even more important than ever. For now, AI still isn't good at putting pieces together at all really. For me, the faster I can put all the pieces together, the faster I can get AI to do the nitty gritty things I want done.

One nice thing about Tailwind that I think will continue to be useful for a long time, is the ability to share styled markup with people easily. It's really convenient to just copy a chunk of HTML and paste it into your project and have it look the same. I certainly appreciate Tailwind and do not wish it to go away, it's just a different use case for me now.
