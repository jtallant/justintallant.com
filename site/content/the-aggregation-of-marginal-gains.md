The concept of the aggregation of marginal gains originates from James Clear's book, <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits" target="_blank">Atomic Habits</a>. I read this book several years ago when it was first published, and it remains the only book whose principles I consistently apply in my daily life.

Often, we set ambitious goals for ourselves, such as getting in better shape, and schedule extensive workout sessions, like an hour of exercise five times a week. We start with enthusiasm, but life inevitably intervenes. Missing a day here and there can lead to abandoning the routine altogether, leaving us feeling guilty every time we see the unfulfilled time slot on our calendar.

The aggregation of marginal gains suggests that even minimal daily efforts can accumulate into significant achievements over time. More importantly, these small actions help establish and reinforce the habit, making it more likely to become a consistent part of our schedule.

Personally, I find this approach most useful during times when I've decided to prioritize something else or I'm too tired to commit to my full routine. Instead of skipping the activity entirely, I might do just five pushups, a few sets at the gym, or 15 minutes of cardio. Initially, this might seem trivial, but it proves highly effective in the long run. These small efforts prevent feelings of guilt and, cumulatively, result in spending more time on the activity than if I had skipped it altogether.

I apply this principle to nearly everything â€” small personal projects, journaling, and more.

Over time, these small gains accumulate into something substantial. More importantly, they help maintain mental focus and keep you on track.
